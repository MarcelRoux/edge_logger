# Edge Logger

This repo aims to provide a template for logging data on edge devices.

This type of logging is typically categorised by the following requirements:
- Reliable
- Fast
- Low storage
- Low power
- Language agnostic

Consequently, [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a library that *implements a small, fast, self-contained, highly-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine*.

Due to these features, this repo aims to provide a framework based on SQLite for logging data at the edge.
